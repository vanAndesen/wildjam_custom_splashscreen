Custom splash screen for Godot Wild Jams

##What is this
This is a custom splash screen scene made to be used for Godot Wild Jams.

This is made for viewport size 1280x720, you can adjust it yourself if you need it larger or smaller.
Will take some GDScript knowledge, but should be rather easy to do.


##How to use
Select the parent node, SplashScreen, and setup the following:
Main Menu: The scene to be loaded once the splash screen is done.
Wild Jam Nr: Type in the number of the Godot Wild Jam your game is for.
Jam Theme: Download the jams theme banner and apply it here.
Wildcard #: Download the jams wildcard images and apply each of them.
Wildcard # Used: Tick the wild cards you used and the tween will play, flipping the cards used as part of the splash screen.
